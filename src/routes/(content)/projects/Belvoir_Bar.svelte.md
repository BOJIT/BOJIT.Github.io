This is an article stub

- Cloudflare have some very cool offerings... seem to be able to just about everything 'on the edge' these days.

- This project based on a very pressing problem: my friends drink a lot of beer. As there's a cost-of living crisis on, they needed a means of bringing their beer spending down. The solution was naturally to build a bar in their living room.

- Now comes the issue of the bar tab...

- All problems can be solved with a Progressive Web App.

- Focus on this article is getting authentication working with cloudflare's KV database.

- Don't want to handle user auth myself: let's use Google!
