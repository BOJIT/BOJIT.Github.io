I only remembered about this project 4 years later when clearing through some old boxes, so apologies if details are a bit patchy.

The general gist of the idea was to create a means of collecting multiple streams of Kinect camera and depth data over a local network. The primary aim was to use [Touchdesigner](/tutorials/Touchdesigner_Image_DMX) to create stage visuals, however I also wanted to try using it to make a low-cost multi-camera 'Motion Capture' studio.

Kinect V2 cameras are generally quite cheap to buy second-hand on eBay, however they require USB 3 connections to a Windows machine. This makes it quite inconvenient to deploy them across a wide area. The plan was to make an 'adapter' that converted Kinect data into a compressed low-latency video stream that could be sent over a network.
