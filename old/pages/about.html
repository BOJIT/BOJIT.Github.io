<p>
	Hi, I am James Bennion-Pedley. I'm an Electronics and Software Hobbyist,
	and a CNC enthusiast. When not working on my various DIY creations I am
	an undergraduate at the <i>Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology</i>.
	In my spare time I work as a Theatre Technician, though often my projects
	end up working themselves onto the stage in some shape or form!
	This website shows a selection of projects I have been working on, 
	along with a few tutorials as well. Many of the projects here are 
	open-source, with source code and schematics available on GitHub.
</p>
