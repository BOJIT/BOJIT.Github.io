Even four years on from when I started working on the car, the CAD modelling was some of the most complex I have done to date. The CAD work from the first draft right through to the initial mould-machining took about a year and a half, in between other projects and commitments. I was learning SolidWorks\u2019 more powerful tools and features as I went along, meaning much of the CAD work had to be re-done with things like in-context dimensions and linked layout sketches, etc\u2026 I had to also ensure that the shell designs were conducive to the composite moulding process, and all of the mechanical parts could be machined in a school workshop.

In an effort to mimic some of the more successful car designs in the competition, we designed the car with all four wheels enclosed to reduce drag on the vehicle. The other important aspect of the design is that the moulding is relatively simple geometry.

Fastening to composite is not always straightforward and we had experienced many problems with the old car where bolts and fixings would tear out of the composite.
