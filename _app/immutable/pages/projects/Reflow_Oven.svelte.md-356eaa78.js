It is worth noting that the control circuit is simple enough to make on stripboard or even just soldered point-to-point, but as I have the equipment to etch simple single-sided boards on hand, this just neatened everything up.

It is worth noting that in this oven, there are 4 heating elements, but they are rated at 120V, so must be wired in series pairs.
