A snippet of my portfolio is shown below. The key thing I was trying to do was create an axis system that kept the spindle rigid in <em>torsion</em>. Normally this is done by making the moving axis very rigid and using linear rails to mount the Z axis to the gantry. However, this design tends to end up being very bulky and heavy. Instead, I looked to try and use a “Cross-Gantry” design where the Z-axis is at the intersection of an X and Y axis. This way, the gantry can be much less substantial, as its twisting motion is resisted by the other gantry that is perpendicular to it.",ot,x,Et='<img src="https://cdn.bojit.org/img/posts/CNC_Project-Brainstorming.PNG" alt="CNC_Project-Brainstorming.PNG"/>',ht,k,Rt=`You can see this scheme more clearly in my machine CAD.

If the stepper motors get out of sync, the machine may end up stalling or pushing the gantry ever so slightly out of square.

I already knew that my machine wasn’t going to have an active mist/flood coolant system, but I wanted to have the option of using air/hand-applied cutting oil if the need arose. Many of the cheaper “X-carve”-style machines simply use the bare slotted extrusion as their linear travel axes.

When designing the CNC, I came to realise exactly why having a CNC machine is so useful! The process of machining all the parts on a manual mill took months! What’s more, at the time I had a very limited understanding of GD&T, so many of the parts I’d designed relied on getting multiple press-fit locating pins to line up between different parts. After quickly realising that my machining skills were not up to the task, I resorted instead to machining a lot of the matching parts in one setup, which led to some quite chaotic mill setups!
