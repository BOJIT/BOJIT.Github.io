However for the light use I will likely get out of a pad set, I can’t really justify the high price for a proper set. So instead, I thought I’d try to make my own!
These DIY drums don’t have any form of sampling capabilities or sound-generation: they only output MIDI. This doesn’t bother me, as all of my drum rack samples are generated in Ableton, however if you wanted to add inbuilt sampling/sound generation there are many Raspberry Pi based projects designed for this task. <a href="https://github.com/auscarpenter/pythonsamplesequencer" rel="nofollow">This one</a> is relatively straightforward to build and interface with a MIDI input.`,O,u,pe='<img src="https://cdn.bojit.org/img/posts/DIY_E_Drums-Roland.JPG" alt="DIY_E_Drums-Roland.JPG"/>',S,c,re="The first and probably most crucial step of the E-Drum creation is to make the piezo pads themselves. There is a wealth of information on the subject online, however most of the similar builds that I found had the pads completely separate from one another. For an <em>SPD SX</em>-style design with all the pads mounted on the same surface in close proximity to one another, crosstalk becomes a major concern. Diagnosing <em>crosstalk</em> through serial and MIDI messages is fairly tiresome, but thankfully I now have an oscilloscope! Below is a picture of me testing a commercial pad (origin unknown) against my homemade pads.

The resistor helps clamp down the noise on the analogue input when the piezo is not struck , while the zener diode simply stops the voltage on the analog input straying outside <code>-0.7V -&gt; 3.3V</code>, protecting the microcontroller hardware.

Once a particular input exceeds this threshold, it is marked as ‘ACTIVE’, and the <code>PAD_HOLDOFF[i]</code> is set as the current timestamp [see code snippet below]. However, the pad can’t be set high unless a certain ‘Holdoff’ period has elapsed. This is a global variable that defines the minimum time between two consecutive triggers.

There are a multitude of methods of processing the input signal to derive a velocity, but the one I like the best is to wait until the most recent input sample is less than the previous sample (i.e. the first local peak has been reached). We then work out the velocity by multiplying the 12-bit anologue input value by 127 and divide through by the ‘working range’ of the ADC <em>(2^12 - Threshold)</em>. This method doesn’t work that well for really soft notes, but it doesn’t involve any averaging or arbitrary delays, so the pads feel really responsive!
