We couldn’t make any permanent changes to the room, but it just so happens that the room is an almost perfect cuboid, so I decided to construct a frame inside the room and make a free-standing dual hammock stand. However, as the room is completely pitched-black when the door is closed, we thought it would be quite fun to put some LED strips around the frame of the room. As it so happened, I had 15m of WS2812b addressable LED tape left over from a previous project, and wanted to try something akin to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca6pjR2TLns" rel="nofollow">Four Tet’s 2018 tour light rig</a>.

It didn’t quite work out as an infinity room - the mylar isn’t that reflective, and getting sheets that large to remain taut and flat without attaching it to the wall was a nigh on impossible.

As it turns out, the room is actually slightly trapezoidal top to bottom, but undersized the frame by a bit anyway to allow for some expansion and contraction of the timber. The most critical part of the frame design was making the entire thing rigid enough to hold two hammocks, while ensuring that each ‘panel’ of the frame could be constructed outside and still fit through the door when it came to the final assembly. I cut it fine on a couple of occasions, but all of the parts did just about fit into the room!",P,d,W='<img src="https://cdn.bojit.org/img/posts/LED_Hammock_Room-Sketch.JPG" alt="LED_Hammock_Room-Sketch.JPG"/>',D,c,N="I don’t really trust my maths when it comes to this kind of project, so I decided to quickly mock up the frame in CAD.

I broke out the Ethernet connection for controlling the tape with <em>ArtNet</em>, and there is even a small USB sound card for doing sound-activated light-shows (though I never actually got round to implementing that in software). The Pi shares the same supply as the LED tape, but the data output is optically isolated (partially for short-circuit protection, but mostly just a lazy 3.3V-5V level conversion with the parts I had on hand).
