The primary aim was to use <a href="/tutorials/Touchdesigner_Image_DMX">Touchdesigner</a> to create stage visuals, however I also wanted to try using it to make a low-cost multi-camera ‘Motion Capture’ studio. The <em>Touchdesigner®</em> software already has Kinect input support (see below), however it can only support one or two Kinects directly connected to the software.',q,d,ot='<img src="https://cdn.bojit.org/img/posts/KinectIP-Depth.PNG" alt="Depth.PNG"/>',N,u,rt='Kinect V2 cameras are generally quite cheap to buy second-hand on eBay, however they require USB 3 connections to a Windows machine. This makes it quite inconvenient to deploy them across a wide area. The plan was to make an ‘adapter’ that converted Kinect data into a compressed low-latency video stream that could be sent over a network. To stream the data, I intended to use the low-bandwidth <a href="https://ndi.video/type/ndi-tools/" rel="nofollow">NDI Protocol</a>. This is a lossy video compression scheme, but it’s very low-latency on a local network and plenty sufficient for the low-resolution images that the kinect outputs.',D,c,pt="For this project, the ideal candiate at the time was a <em>Rock64</em> SBC.

The idea was to create some simple glue logic that would convert the frames into separate NDI streams. I also added a little web-based config panel (back in the days where I still thought PHP was the best thing since sliced bread!)',O,v,ut="As with all projects, a lot of nasty issues ended up surfacing during development.
